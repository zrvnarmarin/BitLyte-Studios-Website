        answer: "Every project comes with its own set of challenges and requirements, which is why we take a tailored approach suitable for your business needs rather than offering a standard package which is same for the every business. It doesn`t work that way, and we want to find the best fitting solutions for you by analysing the market you want to fit in and talk with you about your goals. However, our minimun engagement rate is $500. That being said, for any further questions, please contact us via our form in the ciontact section, or send us an email on bitlyte-studios@admin.com."
